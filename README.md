# Sanitize-Verify
Perl scripts that will sanitize and verify or just verify the device is clean

These files are meant to be used on a generic minimum linux usb.  The 3 files (sanitize.pl, verify.pl, and word.dic are placed in the /usr/local/bin folder.  Only added software to the generic linux build was hdparm and lshw. For Perl Time::Hires for guestimating wipe and verify time.  I used "dd" to read and wipe the device.  Thhe script trys to determine if it has the SATA/ATA secure erase function.  If it does them you can choose either that or a 3 pass overwrite (2 random char overwrites, and a zero overwrite).  It then checks to see if there are any strings found.  The verify portion of the scripts test 10% of the total device and devides the device up in 1024 sections taking 2 random samples in each section. All these are configurable in the init section.  It writes a log file in the /usr/local/bin folder.  Be careful once you say yes (y then enter) after you selected the drive, it does a dd read and write to the same area, but it still looses it's partions, so if you pick the wrong device, you could wipe the wrong device.  If you pick the device you booted from, at least it will tell you that
